# MOTION-DETECTOR-ALARM-CIRCUIT

# ðŸ”§ Motion Detector Alarm Circuit Project

As part of a collaborative project, my team and I designed and built a motion detector alarm circuit. This project involved integrating sensors to detect movement and trigger an alarm, enhancing security and surveillance capabilities. We focused on ensuring the circuit's reliability and responsiveness, applying our knowledge of electronics and programming to achieve an effective solution. This hands-on experience not only deepened our understanding of motion detection technology but also honed our teamwork and problem-solving skills.
